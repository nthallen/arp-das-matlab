## General Purpose Matlab libraries for use with the Anderson Group Data Acquisition Systems

This is a collection of Matlab utility scripts I have found useful over the years. Some of these were hacks to work around Matlab's limitations that have since been fixed.

The ne directory consists of functions used by the scripts generated by [genui](https://www.arp.harvard.edu/eng/das/manuals/genui.html) for displaying instrument engineering data. These routines may also reference some of the functions in the root directory.

The Therm directory contains various scripts for analyzing thermistor performance and generating conversion tables for use with [TMC](https://www.arp.harvard.edu/eng/das/manuals/tmc.html).

Anyone wishing to use the functions in the root directory should of course add that directory to their Matlab path.

Anyone wishing to use this library for viewing engineering data plots, should add both the root directory and the ne directory to their Matlab path.

Adding Therm to the path is optional.
